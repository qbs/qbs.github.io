<p>This topic describes the Qbs features specific to tvOS.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Qbs does not yet support the Swift programming language.</p>
<p>The <a href="qml-qbsmodules-xcode.html">xcode</a> module contains properties and rules for Xcode-based development.</p>
<a name="building-user-interfaces"></a>
<h2 id="building-user-interfaces">Building User Interfaces</h2>
<p>The <a href="qml-qbsmodules-ib.html">ib</a> module contains properties and rules for building Interface Builder documents, storyboards, asset catalogs, and icon sets.</p>
<a name="creating-app-bundles"></a>
<h2 id="creating-app-bundles">Creating App Bundles</h2>
<p>The <a href="qml-qbsmodules-bundle.html">bundle</a> module contains properties and rules for building and working with Core Foundation bundles (application bundles and frameworks) on Apple platforms.</p>
<p>To build an application product as a bundle, or a dynamic or static library product as a framework, add a dependency on the bundle module and set the <a href="qml-qbsmodules-bundle.html#isBundle-prop">bundle.isBundle</a> property to <code>true</code>:</p>
<pre class="cpp">Depends { name: <span class="string">&quot;bundle&quot;</span> }
bundle<span class="operator">.</span>isBundle: <span class="keyword">true</span></pre>
<p>Qbs also provides a number of powerful features to assist in creating the Info.plist file that is part of your bundle. In fact, you do not need to provide an Info.plist file at all. Instead, Qbs will generate one automatically with the necessary keys, based on the values of module properties set in the product.</p>
<p>If you do specify an Info.plist file, Qbs may still inject additional keys into the final output from other sources. One notable source of Info.plist keys are <i>partial</i> Info.plist files which are generated as a result of compiling other resources like asset catalogs, XIBs/NIBs, and storyboards.</p>
<p>You may also use the <code>bundle.infoPlist</code> property to apply a set of key-value pairs to be added to the final Info.plist. This can be used instead of or in addition to an actual Info.plist file on disk.</p>
<a name="multiple-architectures-and-build-variants"></a>
<h2 id="multiple-architectures-and-build-variants">Multiple Architectures and Build Variants</h2>
<p>Qbs uses <a href="multiplexing.html">multiplexing</a> to create multi-architecture <i>fat</i> binaries and multi-variant frameworks, where a single framework can contain both a release and debug build of a library on Apple platforms.</p>
<p>You can set the <code>qbs.architectures</code> property to a list of CPU architectures (such as <code>x86</code>, <code>x86_64</code>, <code>armv7a</code>, <code>armv7k</code>, and <code>arm64</code>), and the <code>qbs.buildVariants</code> property to a list of build variants (such as <code>debug</code> and <code>release</code>), and Qbs will transparently perform the necessary steps to produce the various artifacts and combine them into a single bundle.</p>
<p>Since the individual build configurations are completely independent of one another, you can continue to use conditional branches in your projects such as the following:</p>
<pre class="cpp">Properties {
    condition: qbs<span class="operator">.</span>buildVariant <span class="operator">=</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">&quot;release&quot;</span>
    cpp<span class="operator">.</span>optimization: <span class="string">&quot;small&quot;</span>
}</pre>

<h2 id="whats-new">What&rsquo;s new</h2>
<p>About 105 contributions went into this release since version 1.20.0. We have
selected a few items below. Have a look into the complete
<a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qbs/qbs.git/tree/changelogs/changes-1.21.0.md">changelog</a>
if you are interested in more details.</p>
<h3 id="named-module-providers">Named Module Providers</h3>
<p>We redesigned the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qbs/module-providers.html">module providers</a> feature.
Previously, when Qbs encountered a missing module (say, Qt.core), it searched for a provider
that can generate that module based on the module name - Qbs consecutively searched for providers
named &ldquo;Qt.core&rdquo;, &ldquo;Qt&rdquo; until it found one. This limited the ways to use providers -
ultimately, it was possible to have only one provider for each framework such as
Qt or Boost. Thus, we introduced the new <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qbs-master/qml-qbslanguageitems-product.html#qbsModuleProviders-prop">qbsModuleProviders</a> property to Product and
<a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qbs-master/qml-qbslanguageitems-project.html#qbsModuleProviders-prop">Project</a>
items which allows to specify which providers are run.</p>
<p>For example, to invoke the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmoduleproviders-qt.html">Qt provider</a>
explicitly in your product, you can do the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>CppApplication {
    Depends { name: &#34;Qt.core&#34; }
    files: &#34;main.cpp&#34;
    qbsModuleProviders: [&#34;Qt&#34;]
}
</code></pre><p>It is also possible to prioritize modules generated by different module providers (did I mention
the new <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmoduleproviders-qbspkgconfig.html">qbspkgconfig</a> provider?) -
providers contribute to the qbsSearchPaths in the order specified by the qbsModuleProviders.</p>
<p>In the following example, the &ldquo;Qt.core&rdquo; module can come both from the &ldquo;Qt&rdquo; provider and the
&ldquo;qbspkgconfig&rdquo; provider, but modules generated by the &ldquo;Qt&rdquo; provider have higher priority as it
comes first in the list. This can be useful when you want to use a custom Qt installation (Qt
provider will try to locate qmake in PATH) but also have a fallback for a system Qt
provided by pkg-config.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>CppApplication {
    Depends { name: &#34;Qt.core&#34; }
    files: &#34;main.cpp&#34;
    qbsModuleProviders: [&#34;Qt&#34;, &#34;qbspkgconfig&#34;]
}
</code></pre><p>We plan to add more providers, such as VCPKG or Conan provider in the future.</p>
<h3 id="qbspkgconfig-provider">qbspkgconfig provider</h3>
<p>Originally, Qbs used to use the &ldquo;fallback&rdquo;
<a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qbs-master/module-providers.html#how-qbs-uses-module-providers">provider</a>
based on the pkg-config tool when searhed module was not generated by any other provider. There
are several problems with the &ldquo;fallback&rdquo; provider - it always tries to generate a module using
pkg-config, even for non C++ projects such as Java projects; it does not properly support
packages that have special characters in their names - such names cannot be the name of a Qbs module
(e.g. &ldquo;python-3.9&rdquo; contains a &ldquo;.&rdquo; which is a qualified-id separator). Also, the &ldquo;fallback&rdquo; provider
invoked the pkg-config tool several times per module due to limitations of the pkg-config CLI,
which could lead to bad performance when using multiple packages in a project.</p>
<p>So, we added the new <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmoduleproviders-qbspkgconfig.html">qbspkgconfig</a>
provider which uses the internal C++ library for reading .pc files. This allows Qbs to have
the information about dependencies between pkg-config packages (that info is lost when using
the pkg-config tool) and generate modules with respective <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmoduleproviders-qbspkgconfig.html#mergeDependencies-prop">dependencies</a>. Also, this works much faster
as we now avoid expensive forking for the pkg-config process.</p>
<p>The new provider and the underlying library mimic the pkg-config tool behavior as much as possible
but something might work a bit differently (not always intentional, so feel free to submit
bug reports/suggetions).</p>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<ul>
<li>capnproto and protobuf modules can now use runtime provided by the new qbspkgconfig provider.</li>
<li>Qbs no longer migrates the &ldquo;profiles/&rdquo; dir from earlier Qbs versions (QTCREATORBUG-26475).
Old directories might be cleaned up manually.</li>
<li>We fixed a problem on FreeBSD when QBS did not track changes in files correctly due to the fact
it used low-precision file times (with milliseconds excluded). Now Qbs always uses high-precision
file times on all OSes which may not be supported by some older UNIXes - if you are user of such
OS, please report a bug.</li>
<li>A new ConanfileProbe.verbose property was added which can be useful to debug problems with
Conan.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cc-support">C/C++ Support</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for C++23.</li>
<li>Add Elbrus E2K architecture for the GCC toolchain
<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QBS-1675">QBS-1675</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="android-support">Android Support</h2>
<ul>
<li>A new Android.ndk.buildId
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmodules-android-ndk.html#buildId-prop">property</a> was added which
allows to overwrite the default value (sha1) for the &ndash;build-id linker flag.</li>

<a href="https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&amp;substr=qbs">MacPorts</a>,
<a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qbs">Homebrew</a>) and is updated on each
release by the Qbs development team. It can also be installed through
the native package management system on a number of Linux distributions.
Please find a complete overview on
<a href="https://repology.org/project/qbs/versions">repology.org</a>.
Qbs 1.21.0 is also included in Qt Creator 6.0.0 which was released recently.</p>

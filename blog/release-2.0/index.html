            <p>The <a href="http://qbs.io">Qbs build tool</a> version 2.0.0 is available.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new">What&rsquo;s new</h2>
<p>If this release looks a bit short on features, that&rsquo;s because a lot of work was spent on one
rather daunting task, namely:</p>
<h3 id="new-javascript-backend">New JavaScript backend</h3>
<p>When the deprecation of QtScript was announced for Qt 6, we quickly started looking for a
light-weight replacement for our JavaScript backend, as the prospect of maintaining QtScript
with its complex JavaScriptCore dependency ourselves did not seem particularly appealing. However,
none of the candidates offered an API to intercept property accesses, which we absolutely require
for performance reasons. That changed when <a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/">QuickJS</a> came along, so
we could finally start porting, and just a couple of <del>days</del> <del>weeks</del> months later we had a
functional new backend.</p>
<p>From a user&rsquo;s point of view, there should not be any noticeable changes; in particular, the
performance appears to be about the same. However, QtScript was rather forgiving about accepting
undefined values in contexts where it didn&rsquo;t have to, so the new implementation might uncover
some glitches in your projects.</p>
<p>As a final point, the magnitude of this change gave us an excuse to bump the major version number, so we did.</p>
<h3 id="removal-of-qmake-project-files">Removal of qmake project files</h3>
<p>With our cmake project files having been feature complete for a while now (not to mention the
qbs ones), the qmake project files became mostly a maintenance burden and were removed.</p>
<h2 id="whats-kinda-new">What&rsquo;s kinda new</h2>
<p>Some more relevant changes since our last blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new <a href="https://qbs.io/docs/jsextension-host/">Host</a> extension offers information about
the host system. Most of its functions used to be properties of the qbs module, but did not
belong there.</li>
<li>The new <a href="https://qbs.io/docs/qml-qbsmodules-sanitizers-address/">Sanitizers.address</a> module
provides <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">ASAN</a> support for projects
in a convenient manner.</li>
<li>The FileInfo extension has an executableSuffix function now.</li>
<li>ModuleProvider items now support Probes.</li>
<li>We added support for the OpenWatcom toolchain.</li>
<li>Android multi-arch packages are supported again wth Qt &gt;= 6.3.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next</h2>
<p>While it&rsquo;s still a couple of months away, we can already say that the 2.1 release will see a
long-overdue rewrite of our project resolving code. If you think that&rsquo;s irrelevant to you as a
user, you might be surprised by the performance implications. More details in the next blog post.</p>
<h2 id="try-it">Try it</h2>
<p>Qbs is available for download on the <a href="https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qbs/1.23.0">download

<a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qbs">Homebrew</a>) and is updated on each
release by the Qbs development team. It can also be installed through
the native package management system on a number of Linux distributions.

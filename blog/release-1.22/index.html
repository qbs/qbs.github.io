<h2 id="whats-new">What&rsquo;s new</h2>
<p>About 82 contributions went into this release since version 1.21.0. We have
selected a few items below. Have a look into the complete
<a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qbs/qbs.git/tree/changelogs/changes-1.22.0.md">changelog</a>
if you are interested in more details.</p>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new Host service was introduced, providing information about the host system that
used to be available from the qbs module, but did not really belong there. In addition, some more
qbs module properties have moved to the FileInfo service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>product</em> variable in <em>Export</em> items now points to the importing product, rather than
the exporting one. This change matches the behavior of the <em>product</em> variable in <em>Module</em> items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Probe</em> items are now also available in <em>ModuleProvider</em> items.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cc-support">C/C++ Support</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the Open Watcom toolchain.</li>
<li>Reduced unneeded re-linking on Linux by ignoring changes to weak symbols in library
dependencies by default.</li>
<li>Adapted to changes in Xcode 13.3 (<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QBS-1693">QBS-1693</a>).</li>
</ul>
